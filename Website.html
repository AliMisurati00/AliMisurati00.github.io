                    As part of our design coursework, we were tasked with creating a magazine cover using Adobe InDesign. The objective was to explore layout design, typographic hierarchy, and visual storytelling, all crucial skills in editorial design. This assignment encouraged us to express our individual aesthetic preferences while learning how to translate conceptual ideas into polished visual compositions.
                    <br><br>
                    For my cover, I created an edition of a fictional magazine titled GRAIN, themed around urban street culture. The issue, dated October 2024, is anchored by the cover story “Through the Concrete Lens”, which focuses on capturing authentic street life. Another featured article, “Street Art: The Urban Canvas”, highlights the creativity and social commentary embedded in urban graffiti and murals.
                    <br><br>
                    The design features a minimalist yet bold layout, with the typography and imagery working together to evoke the raw, dynamic energy of the streets. I chose a subdued, grayscale palette with contrasting highlights to draw attention to key text elements, lending the cover a gritty, documentary-style feel. The intent was to reflect the unfiltered realism of city life while maintaining a clean, editorial aesthetic.
                    <br><br>
                    This project not only enhanced my technical proficiency with InDesign but also deepened my understanding of how to communicate mood and narrative through graphic design.
